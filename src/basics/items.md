# Items

Items are the atomic parts of sequences, and represent values.

The following examples for items are direct values that, once specified, stay on their own.

```tokay
123               # the number 123
true              # the boolean value for truth
"Tokay ðŸ¦Ž"        # a unicode string
```

Items can also be the result of expressions or calls to callable objects.

```tokay
"a " + "string"   # concatenating a string
42 * 23.5         # the result of a multiplication
'check'           # the occurence of string "check" in the input
Integer           # calling a built-in token for parsing integer values
func(42)          # calling a function
++count           # the incremented value of count
```

But items can also be more complex.

```tokay
x = count * 23.5  # the result of a calculation is assigned to a variable
if x > 100 "much" # conditional expression, which is either "more" or void
```

> Every single value, call, expression, control-flow statement or even block is considered to be an item.

There is also a special value called `void`, which means just "nothing".

In the above provided examples, the assignment returns `void` because the result of the calculation is stored to a variable.<br>
The conditional `if`-clause below either returns a string when the condition is met, otherwise it also returns `void`. Using the `else` keyword, it would also be possible to return another value instead, e.g.

```tokay
if x > 100 "much" else "less"
```

## Severities

Every item has a severity, which defines its value's "weight".

This is not important for the first steps and programs with Tokay, but a fundamental feature of the magic behind Tokay's automatic value construction features, which will be discussed later.

Tokay currently knows 4 levels of severitity:

1. Whitespace
2. Match
3. Value
4. Result

The severity of an item depends on how it is constructed. For example

```tokay
123               # pushes 123 with severity 3
_                 # matches whitespace
'check'           # matches "check" in input and pushes it considered as match
''check''         # matches "check" in input and pushes it considered as value
'check' * 3       # matches "check" in input and repeats it 3 times, resuling in value
push "yes"        # pushes result value "yes"
```

## Conclusion


In conclusion, an item is the result of some expression which always stands for a value. An item in turn is part of a sequence. Every item has a hidden severity, which is important for constructing values from sequences later on.
